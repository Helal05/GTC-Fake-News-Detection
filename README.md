# Fake News Detection  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a system to detect **fake news articles** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The main goal is to classify news content as *real* or *fake* to help combat misinformation and promote reliable information sharing.  

## Features (planned)  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of text data.  
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.).  
- Machine learning and deep learning models for classification.  
- Model evaluation and performance comparison.
